Since Java 6 update 22 you now need to sign your applet to properly access the native methods responsible for accessing the MAC address, otherwise the method calls will return nothing, you can also check the java console for exceptions.

That's it; this is a simple applet to illustrate getting a machines MAC address or addresses and also how to interact with Java applets from Javascript.

See the web directory for sample html and this is also the install directory so you may test the applet via a browser, copy the web directory to any web server and you should be ready to test.

How to sign your applet, this example will use a self signed exception:wq
